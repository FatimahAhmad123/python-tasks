# Python Tasks
## Task 1: Divisibility Checker
Python script that finds and prints numbers in the range from 2000 to 3600 that are divisible by 7 but not divisible by 5, separated by commas.

## Task 2: System Info
Python script that displays various system parameters like byte order, CPU information, cache sizes and distributor details.

## Task 3: Grouping People by Occupation in a Json File
Python script that reads data from a JSON file containing information about people and groups them by occupation. The result is saved to another JSON file.
### Instructions:
Make sure you have a JSON file named "Input.json" in the same directory as your script.
The "Input.json" file should contain data about people, with each person represented as a dictionary with attributes like "name," "age," and "occupation."

## Task 4: Task 4: Calculate Distance
Python script that calculates the distance between two coordinates provided as command-line arguments using the math module and argparse for argument parsing.

## Task 5: File Operations and Permissions
Python scripts to create, modify permissions, and read/write to a specified file path. Identify and resolve issues related to file operations.

### Note:
It is expected to face issues when you modify permissions for the files, so run the reslove_issues script then.

## Task 6: Data Processing and Plotting
Read data from a text file, convert it to a list, calculate squares and cubes, and create a graph of square vs. cube using matplotlib.

### Instructions:
First make a virtual environment in the folder and then run the script. for the virtual environment first make sure it is installed in your system. Then run the commands:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
source myenv/bin/activate

# Deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate
```

## Task 7: Parallel Task Execution
Two Python scripts to find divisible numbers in specified ranges both synchronously and asynchronously. Measure and log the time taken for execution.

## Task 8: File Statistics with Numpy
Python sript to calculate various statistics (mean, median, max, min, etc.) for a text file's contents using the numpy module.

## Task 9: Websockets Client-Server Application
Python scripts to develop a client-server application using websockets. The client reads JSON data, sends messages to the server, and receives responses with timestamps. Messages are logged.
